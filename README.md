###### This project main objective is to transform an already made shopping-wizard in JS to a full shopping site with full PHP. The developers of the original project are refered at the end of this document.

## Main objectives
* Create a main page for the site to show all the products in catalog.json, which will already have a list of default products.
* Create a form validation system with PHP or use a PHP library to validate forms.
* Create an admin section to allow site managers to add new products, view users information and add new users.
* Manage all the data with 3 main JSON files and import the data with PHP.

## Folder structure
